Solutions to problems in Online Judges
===
This repository was made with the intention of backing up my solutions for future reference, as well as serve as a reference for people who might be looking for help. Please use this sparingly. **The code is not maintained, and probably never will be.**

The repositiory does not reflect the actual statistics of my sessions on online judges. There are a few solutions whose solutions I forgot to save, or cannot otherwise source. I'll try to keep it complete.

But _no guaruntees_. I am too lazy.

Ohh! And do take a look at the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) before you do something with the code.
